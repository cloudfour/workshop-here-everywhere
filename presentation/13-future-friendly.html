<div class="section slide level2" id="dont-give-into-despair">
<h1>Don’t give into despair</h1>
<ul>
<li>It’s easy to give up in the face of the zombie hoards</li>
<li>Don’t be paralyzed by the choice of weapons:
<ul>
<li>Responsive web design</li>
<li>Device detection</li>
<li>Mobile web apps</li>
<li>PhoneGap</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When faced with an immediate problem, grab the weapon closest to you and get your kill in.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="but-when-fortifying-your-camp-think-strategically">
<h1>But when fortifying your camp, think strategically</h1>
<ul>
<li>We don’t know what devices are coming.</li>
<li>We can’t guarentee success against the next wave of zombies.</li>
<li>But we can build fortifications that are more likely to withstand the test.</li>
<li>We know it’s hard when staring into the eyes of the undead, but you’ve got to think…</li>

<div class="section slide level2" id="laser-focus">
<h1>Laser Focus</h1>
<p>We can't be all things on all devices. To manage in a world of ever-increasing device complexity, we need to focus on what matters most to our customers and businesses. Not by building lowest common-denominator solutions but by creating meaningful content and services.</p>
<p>People are also increasingly tired of excessive noise and finding ways to simplify things for themselves. Focus your service before your customers and increasing diversity do it for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="orbit-around-data">
<h1>Orbit Around Data</h1>
<p>An ecosystem of devices demands to be interoperable, and robust data exchange is the easiest way to get going. Be responsive to existing and emerging opportunities by defining your data in a way that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enables multiple (flexible) forms of access and notifications</li>
<li>Uses standards to be interoperable</li>
<li>Focuses on long term integrity</li>
<li>Includes meaningful and permanent references to all content</li>
<li>Supports both read and write operations</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="universal-content">
<h1>Universal Content</h1>
<p>Well-structured content is now an essential part of art direction. Consider how it can flow into a variety of containers by being mindful of their constraints and capabilities. Be bold and explore new possibilities but know the future is likely to head in many directions.</p>
<p>Highly capable smart devices, simple constrained devices, interoperable devices and (a whole lot) more are part of our future. Structure and store your content accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="unknown-vessel-identify">
<h1>Unknown Vessel, Identify</h1>
<p>Reacting to every device variance makes inclusive design extremely challenging. A high-level, close-enough set of standards for device types can simplify the process of adaptation. Additional, detailed profile information can supplement these standards.</p>
<p>A taxonomy of device types can align manufacturers today while still allowing new devices types to emerge tomorrow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="command-your-fleet">
<h1>Command Your Fleet</h1>
<p>Having a wide range of devices in our lives enables us to distribute tasks and information between them. When an experience is managed within a device collection, each device can tackle the interactions it does best. This negates the need to tailor all aspects of a service to every device and allows us to work within an ecosystem of device capabilities instead.</p>

<div class="section slide level2" id="when-the-authorities-fail-to-react-with-due-speed">
<h1>When the authorities fail to react with due speed</h1>
<p>Does this sound familiar?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response of authorities to the threat is slower than its rate of growth, giving the zombie plague time to expand beyond containment. This results in the collapse of the given society. Zombies take full control while small groups of the living must fight for their survival. -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_apocalypse" title="Wikipedia article on Zombie Apocalypse">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="mobile-web-lags-behind">
<h1>Mobile web lags behind</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The standards process will be painfully slow. We will struggle with (and eventually agree upon) appropriate standards. During this period, the web will fall even further behind proprietary solutions. -- <a href="http://futurefriend.ly" title="Future Friendly">FutureFriend.ly</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="there-is-hope">
<h1>There is hope</h1>
<p>We can work together to build a better mobile web and tame these zombies. Some day, we may even find that living in a world with all these devices is no longer terrifying.</p>
<p>In fact, it might be a lot of fun.</p>
</div>
<div class="section slide level2" id="congratulations-cadets">
<h1>Congratulations cadets!</h1>
<p>You’ve survived boot camp. Grab your weapons and your rucksack and go help others prepare for the zombie onslaught before it is too late!</p>
