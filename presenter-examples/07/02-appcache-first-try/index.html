          <p>All right, you lazy clowns! Guess what's for breakfast tomorrow?! Pancakes, with heaps of real Vermont maple syrup and all the fresh creamery butter you could dream of, just softly melting down that pile of flapjacks.</p>
           <p>Stop drooling, you morons! We're having something I'll call <em>oatmeal</em>, although the presence of oats is negligible. It's putrid hue of grey should complement the sad urn of coffee-flavored Bevarine I'll be heating up just for y'alls. Oh, wait? We had that today? Well, maybe you should kill some more zombies so <b>civilization</b> can return to earth!</p>

          <p>The only DVD I could find out there this week that hasn't been melted or shot at is a copy of <em>"Shark Attack 3: Megalodon"</em>. If the generator holds out long enough in the movie tent, we'll be watching it at 2200 tomorrow.</p>

          <small>20120621//1655 :: Drill Sergeant Binton</small>
          <p>I've had enough of you lazy slobs! Stop leaving those pizza boxes along the perimeter fence after you're done eating at non-approved times during duty! Just because you leave them there doesn't mean I won't find them...and you know who else likes the smell of pizza? <strong>ZOMBIES</strong>.</p>
          <p>Next layabout I find snarfing down a slice while on watch is getting KP.</p>
