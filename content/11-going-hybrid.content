% Hybrid native app development using web technologies (PhoneGap Build)

## A blistering quick ride through hybrid-land

### Reverse: Hybrid structure

TODO: IMAGE

Sometimes you need to do something that you just can't quite pull off (yet) on the mobile web.

Sometimes zombies mate with the populace at large and the offspring get the best of both worldsâ€”web-based technologies wrapped in native app goodness.

Giddyup!

## PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build

### Figure: PhoneGap Platforms

* PhoneGap is one option for using HTML5 technologies to create native apps for multiple platforms.

## PhoneGap Build

* With PhoneGap Build you can build your projects in the cloud (that is, you don't have to compile/build natively for each platform yourself).

## Anatomy of a PhoneGap project

TODO: IMAGE

* Web stuff: HTML, JS, CSS, images, whatever!
* A config.xml file
* For PhoneGap Build, ZIP it up and then upload it.

## The PhoneGap API

In our quick example, we're simply going to wrap the existing "I Got One!" application and make it native. But that doesn't use PhoneGap to its true advantage...

Phonegap.js provides a universal JavaScript API to access device features not exposed to the browser (yet).

## No really, it's pretty danged easy

Let's see how fast we can bust out a native Android version of "I Got One!".

### How to make a PhoneGap Build project

1. Create a config.xml file.
2. ZIP up our files.
3. Upload and build.
4. Install on device.

## Anatomy of a config.xml

### Code

~~~ {.xml}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <widget xmlns = "http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets"
        xmlns:gap = "http://phonegap.com/ns/1.0"
        id        = "com.cloudfour.gotone"
        versionCode="10"
        version   = "1.0.0">

    <name>I Got One</name>

## Let's add some icons

### Code

~~~ {.xml}
    <preference name="orientation" value="portrait" />

    <icon src="app-icons/touch-icon-iphone.png" width="57" height="57"/>
    <icon src="app-icons/touch-icon-ipad.png" width="72" height="72"/>
    <icon src="app-icons/touch-icon-iphone4.png" width="114" height="114"/>

    <gap:splash src="app-icons/splash.png" width="320" height="480" />
    <gap:splash src="app-icons/splash-2x.png" width="640" height="960"/>
</widget>

##### config.xml

## ZIP, Upload, Build
