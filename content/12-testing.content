% Ugh, Testing
% Getting started in the scary world of testing

## Some perspective

> If you think your web site works, you just haven’t tested enough. It is broken somewhere.
> —Lyza Gardner

## We can’t test everything

* No one tests every possible device and browser combination.
* Even on desktop, we don’t test every possible combination.
* So we have to make practical decisions about what we can reasonably test and develop sites in a way that minimizes potential issues.

## What does it mean to “support” a device?

* We think of support as coming in three tiers:
    * Devices and browsers that we explicitly support.
    * Devices and browsers that we don’t explicitly support, but that we expect to work in some fashion because we’ve built the site with best practices.
    * Devices and browsers we cannot support because they don’t meet a minimum bar for the application or site.
* The devices and browsers that we explicitly support are the ones we need to test on.

# How do you decide what devices to support?

## Requirements

* Browser features
* Device capabilities
* Hardware performance
* Network speed & availability

## Audience

* Analytics
* Surveying
* Geographic Trends
* Demographics

## Beware of the analytics trap

> We can’t predict future behavior from a current experience that sucks.

# Building a device testing library.

## Priority of devices will depend on what you support

* Let your project work dictate the order in which you buy devices.
* Once you have a foundation, plan for buying devices on a regular basis. Make it a known recurring expense. Include buying devices in project budgets.
* Save money by buying used devices.
* Buy GSM phones so you can use a single SIM card for all the phones.
* Get a microSIM adapter so you can move a microSIM into a regular-sized SIM slot.
* Work with others in your community to share devices.
* Don’t forget your local testing center (AKA, your carrier store)

## A suggested starter kit.

* iOS devices: focus on old devices like the original iPod Touch and older iPhones. It is very likely that you or your co-workers already own iOS devices that you can borrow.
* Android: Buy unlocked GSM versions of each Nexus device. Get a Samsung Galaxy S and a more recent Galaxy device.
* Blackberry: Vary the input between those that have touch and those that don’t. BB6.0 and above are WebKit and substantially better. 5.0 is ok. 4.x is horrible.
* Windows Phone: Nokia Lumia line is the best option.
* Symbian: So many Nokia devices. Look at your traffic logs and pick the most popular.

# Tools for testing.

## Beefing up your desktop browser

* [User agent switcher](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/)
* [User agent switcher config file](http://techpatterns.com/forums/about304.html)
* [Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh) / [Web Developer Toolkit](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/)
* [Mobile Performance Bookmarklets](http://stevesouders.com/mobileperf/mobileperfbkm.php)
* [jDrop](http://jdrop.org/)
* [Blaze.io Mobile Test](http://blaze.io/mobile)

## Adobe Shadow

* Fantastic [new tool for testing](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/shadow.html).
* Works on iOS and Android
* Demostration

## Other tools

* [Weinre](http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/): Foundation for Adobe Shadow
* [Debug.phonegap.com](http://debug.phonegap.com/): Free hosted version of weinre. Demo. Good for using on platforms that Adobe Shadow doesn’t support or if you need to test the actual browser.
* [Drive-in](https://github.com/scottjehl/Drive-In) and [Shim](https://github.com/marstall/shim#readme): Push pages like Adobe Shadow
* [Device Anywhere](http://www.keynotedeviceanywhere.com/) and [Perfecto Mobile](http://www.perfectomobile.com/): real remote debugging

## Testing improves with practice

> The dirty little secret is that the more you test—the more accurately you will determine when it’s ok not to.
