#### Do This!

1. Download and unzip the ZIP file from <http://cloudfour.github.com/workship.zip> (14MB).
3. Put the contents of the ZIP archive somewhere that you can view them in a browser. Bonus: If you run a local web server, put these files somewhere that they can be served by the server.
4. Open the file `fieldnotes.html` in a browser. These are your follow-along resources and references.
