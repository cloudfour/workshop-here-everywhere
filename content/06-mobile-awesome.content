## HTML5 APIs and features for the Web

* Device APIs
* HTML Programmable APIs
* HTML5 Elements
* Other HTML Goodies

## Device APIs

> "Cross-platform...Sensors, data and outputs" —Brian LeRoux (PhoneGap)

* Media Capture
* Contacts API
* Network Information API
* Battery Status API
* GeoLocation API
* Accelerometer, vibration, etc.

## HTML5 Programmable APIs and Goodies

* Drag and drop
* Web Workers
* Web Sockets
* Offline functionality via Application Cache and localStorage
* Media Capture (hey...wait...?)

## HTML5 Elements

* `<section>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, etc.
* New support for many different `<input>` types—big yay for mobile!
* Embedding and objects: `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<canvas>`

# Let's have a bit more fun with Geolocation

## W3C Geolocation API

Geolocation is the darling of many. It's consummately mobile and easy to describe. There are oh so many ways to make good use of a user's current location to deliver adapted experiences or add functionality to applications. Whee!

* The W3C Geolocation API is a standard way of exposing geolocation information to JavaScript in the browser. It is rather well adopted.
* Browsers that implement the W3C Geolocation API expose the `navigator.geolocation` object and its methods to the browser.

## Using the W3C API to get the current location

Here's what it looks like:

~~~ {.javascript}
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(successCallback, errorCallback)
~~~

### Illustration: getCurrentPosition

## And what happens in the success callback?

# Let's try it out

Hey, let's build a basic geolocation test page to see how that geolocation API works.

## Testing for API support

~~~ {.javascript}
<script>
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    // Do something, dammit!
  }
</script>
~~~

## Doing something, dammit

~~~ {.javascript}
if (navigator.geolocation) {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(onGeoSuccess, onGeoError);
} else {
  alert('Sorry, Geolocation not supported in this browser!');
}
~~~

In our version, we're going to use a function called `onGeoSuccess` for a success callback and `onGeoError` for an error callback.

## And now what...?

We need to define our success and error callbacks.

~~~ {.javascript}
function onGeoSuccess(position) {
  var coordinates = position.coords;
  alert(coordinates.latitude + ", " + coordinates.longitude);
}
function onGeoError(error) {
  alert(error.message);
}
~~~

In our success callback, we're looking at the `coords` on the `position` object.

The error callback is always passed an `error` object.

## All together, now

~~~{.javascript}
if (navigator.geolocation) {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(onGeoSuccess, onGeoError);
} else {
  alert('Sorry, Geolocation not supported in this browser!');
}
function onGeoSuccess(position) {
  var coordinates = position.coords;
  alert(coordinates.latitude + ", " + coordinates.longitude);
}
function onGeoError(error) {
  alert(error.message);
}
~~~


## Another need for the troops

# Creating an Offline Mode using ApplicationCache

## ApplicationCache

* An API that is part of the HTML5 spec
* Define what resources should (or should not be) cached using a cache manifest
* ApplicationCache object and its methods exposed to JavaScript

#### The idea is to create an *offline mode* for your web site or app by defining which resources should be cached by the browser and available offline.

##  Cache manifests

A *cache manifest* is a text file that lets you tell the client about resources that should be cached.

You use cache manifests to define what ends up in the ApplicationCache.

## Cache manifests at a glance

To create and use a cache manifest:

1. Write a cache manifest file that lists resources on the site that the browser should cache.
2. Configure your web server to serve the cache manifest as the correct `MIME` type. (This requirement is going away).
3. Tell browsers about your manifest by using the `manifest` attribute on the `<html>` tag.


## Step 1: Writing the manifest

### Cache manifest syntax

Writing a cache manifest file sounds simple—in premise. In its simplest:

~~~
CACHE MANIFEST

CACHE:
foo.jpg
bar.png
index.html
ding/dong.html
~~~

##### manifest.appcache

## Step 2: Serving cache manifests

Cache manifest files must be served as a particular `MIME` type (`text/cache-manifest`) or browsers will not recognize them.

Often this can be handled by adding the following to your `.htaccess` or other Apache configuration file:

`AddType text/cache-manifest .appcache`

(Preferred extension is `.appcache`)

## Step 3: Tell the browser about your manifest

There is a `manifest` attribute on the `html` element.

`<html manifest="manifest.appcache">`

## Ways things end up in appCache

* Listed in the cache manifest file (explicit)
* Is a document with a manifest attribute defined (implicit)

## Be very wary

## Conclusion

Cache manifest can be a good approach for creating offline modes of web sites and apps. It tends to be more manageable for smaller or app-like web sites.

## Clarence has something to say

## When in battle, remember three things

Yahoo has 14 rules and there are even more things that improve performance, but majority of sites benefit most from four things:

1. Well-compressed images
2. Turning on GZIP
3. Reducing HTTP requests
4. Setting Far Future Expires headers

## Drop-in .htaccess/Apache solutions

### Turn off eTags and Turn *ON* GZip

~~~~
FileETag none

<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
  SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
  # Don’t compress
  SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \.(?:gif|jpe?g|png)$ no-gzip dont-vary
  SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \.(?:exe|t?gz|zip|bz2|sit|rar)$ no-gzip dont-vary
  #Dealing with proxy servers
  <IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header append Vary User-Agent
  </IfModule>
</IfModule>

AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE image/x-icon
~~~~

##### .htaccess

## Configure far-future expires headers

~~~~
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
ExpiresActive On
ExpiresByType text/html "access plus 1 seconds"
ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 2 years"
ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 2 years"
ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 2 years"
ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 2 years"
ExpiresByType text/javascript "access plus 2 years"
ExpiresByType application/x-javascript "access plus 2 years"
ExpiresByType image/x-icon "access plus 2 years"
</IfModule>
~~~~

##### .htaccess (cont.)

## Hey, look at that

## So, this doesn't work everywhere

A lot of modern browsers implement the W3C geolocation API and Application Cache. But some don't. How can we tell?
